# OmniFocus Integration Goals and Scope

## Project Overview
This document outlines the high-level objectives, scope, and planning considerations for integrating OmniFocus with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) system.

## High-Level Objectives

### Primary Integration Goals

1. **Push MCP Actions to OmniFocus**
   - Enable MCP to create tasks, projects, and contexts in OmniFocus
   - Support automatic task creation from MCP workflow triggers
   - Maintain task metadata and relationships during transfer

2. **Pull Tasks from OmniFocus into MCP**
   - Allow MCP to read and access OmniFocus task data
   - Enable querying of tasks by project, context, status, and dates
   - Support task completion status synchronization

3. **Bidirectional Synchronization (Limited Scope)**
   - Define specific data fields that sync both ways
   - Establish conflict resolution strategies
   - Set boundaries on what should NOT be synchronized

## Integration Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope
- [ ] Basic task CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Project and context management
- [ ] Due date and reminder synchronization
- [ ] Completion status updates
- [ ] Note/description field synchronization
- [ ] Tag/context mapping between systems

### Out of Scope (Initial Phase)
- [ ] Full attachment/file synchronization
- [ ] Complex OmniFocus perspective recreation in MCP
- [ ] Real-time live synchronization (batch sync preferred)
- [ ] OmniFocus automation/AppleScript integration
- [ ] Historical change tracking beyond basic timestamps

### Technical Boundaries
- **Sync Frequency**: Maximum every 15 minutes to avoid API rate limits
- **Data Volume**: Initial focus on active/incomplete tasks only
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with user notification
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with manual retry options

## Stakeholder Definitions

- **Product**: Product management and strategy
- **Engineering**: Development team and technical architecture
- **UX**: User experience and interface design
- **QA**: Quality assurance and testing
- **Security**: Security and compliance review
- **DevOps**: Operations and infrastructure
- **Users**: End users and beta testers

## Priority Definitions

- **High**: Must-have for MVP, blocks other features
- **Medium**: Important for user experience, can be phased
- **Low**: Nice-to-have, future enhancement

## Key Open Questions for Stakeholder Review

1. **Technical Foundation**
   - Which OmniFocus API/integration method provides the best balance of functionality and reliability?
   - Should we prioritize read-only integration first, then add write capabilities?

2. **User Experience**
   - How should users discover and configure this integration?
   - What level of sync granularity do users actually want?

3. **Data Strategy**
   - Which direction of sync (MCP→OF vs OF→MCP) provides more immediate value?
   - How do we handle the impedance mismatch between MCP's context model and OmniFocus's project/context model?

4. **Success Metrics**
   - How will we measure the success of this integration?
   - What user behaviors indicate the integration is providing value?

## Next Steps

1. **Technical Investigation** (Engineering)
   - Research OmniFocus API capabilities and limitations
   - Prototype basic read/write operations
   - Assess performance characteristics

2. **User Research** (Product/UX)
   - Interview potential users about their workflow needs
   - Understand current pain points in task management across systems
   - Validate assumptions about desired sync behavior

3. **Architecture Planning** (Engineering)
   - Design sync architecture and data flow
   - Plan error handling and recovery strategies
   - Define integration testing approach

4. **Scope Refinement** (Product/Engineering)
   - Based on technical findings, refine what's feasible for MVP
   - Prioritize features based on user research findings
   - Set realistic timeline expectations
